# Project Hermes
## What is "Project Hermes"?
Project Hermes is a password-retrieval system, designed for extracting *browser* passwords from any computer. I am designing this system for myself, as I need to migrate all of my computers' saved passwords, over to a central machine.

## How Do I Run Project Hermes?
Make sure you have the following items:    
* Python 2.7
* Platform-specific
    * Windows:
        * [`pywin32`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/latest/download)

Clone this repository to your computer, open the folder, and run the `main.py` file, with `python main.py`

*This code only works on Darwin-based (macOS) systems, at the moment*
